# âœ… NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT SUCCESS GUIDE

## Build India Group - Ready for Deployment

### Issue Resolved
The "Deploy directory 'dist' does not exist" error has been fixed by:

1. **Cleaned Build Configuration**
   - Updated `package.json` with proper TypeScript build process
   - Fixed `vite.config.ts` for optimal production builds
   - Ensured `tsconfig.json` includes all React files correctly

2. **Removed Angular Conflicts**
   - All Angular artifacts that were causing build conflicts have been identified
   - Pure React/Vite setup is now in place
   - Build process will create the `dist` directory correctly

### Deployment Steps

#### Option 1: Netlify CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI if not already installed
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Build locally to verify
npm install
npm run build

# Deploy to Netlify
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

#### Option 2: Git-based Deployment
1. Push this code to your Git repository
2. Connect the repository to Netlify
3. Netlify will automatically detect the build settings from `netlify.toml`

### Build Settings (Configured in netlify.toml)
- **Build Command**: `npm ci && npm run build`
- **Publish Directory**: `dist`
- **Node Version**: 18
- **Environment**: Production optimized

### Domain Setup
