# 🔧 TROUBLESHOOT BUILD INDIA GROUP DEPLOYMENT

## ❌ ISSUE: Website Not Showing at https://buildindiagroup.netlify.app

### 🔍 DIAGNOSIS
Your files are still in Figma Make environment - they haven't been properly uploaded to Netlify yet.

## ✅ SOLUTION: STEP-BY-STEP FIX

### Step 1: Check Netlify Deployment Status
1. **Login to Netlify**: [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Email: trivedianant@gmail.com
   - Password: Biraja&pradosh@001

2. **Check Your Site**
   - Look for site named "buildindiagroup"
   - Check deployment status (should show "Published" in green)
   - If it shows "Failed" or "Building", click on it for details

### Step 2: If No Site Exists - Deploy Now
**The files need to be uploaded from this Figma Make environment to Netlify:**

#### Method A: Manual File Upload (Recommended)
1. **Create Project Folder** on your computer:
   ```
   build-india-group-website/
   ```

2. **Copy These Key Files** (in this exact order):
   - `App.tsx` ✅
   - `main.tsx` ✅  
   - `index.html` ✅
   - `package.json` ✅
   - `vite.config.ts` ✅
   - `netlify.toml` ✅
   - **Entire `components/` folder** ✅
   - **Entire `hooks/` folder** ✅
   - **Entire `styles/` folder** ✅

3. **Upload to Netlify**:
   - Go to Netlify dashboard
   - Drag the `build-india-group-website` folder to deploy area
   - Wait for build to complete (2-3 minutes)

### Step 3: Common Build Errors & Fixes

#### Error: "Build failed"
**Check Netlify build logs for:**

1. **Missing Dependencies**
   ```
   Solution: Ensure package.json includes all required packages
   ```

2. **Import Errors**
   ```
   Error: Cannot resolve './components/HeroSection'
   Solution: Ensure all component files are in components/ folder
   ```

3. **TypeScript Errors**
   ```
   Solution: All .tsx files must be included
   ```

### Step 4: Verify File Structure
**Your uploaded folder MUST contain:**

```
build-india-group-website/
├── App.tsx                    ✅ Main app
├── main.tsx                   ✅ Entry point
