# Deployment Fix - Build India Group

## Issue
Netlify deployment failing with "Deploy directory 'dist' does not exist" error.

## Root Cause
Mixed Angular/React files causing TypeScript compilation conflicts preventing the `dist` directory from being created during build.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Build Configuration
- Fixed `package.json` build script to use `tsc --noEmit` (type checking only)
- Updated `vite.config.ts` for cleaner build process
- Ensured `tsconfig.json` includes all necessary React files

### 2. Clean Build Process
- Build command: `npm install && npm run build`
- Output directory: `dist` (as configured in Vite)
- Node version: 18 (specified in netlify.toml)

### 3. Next Steps for Deployment
1. Remove any remaining Angular files from the repository
2. Test local build with `npm run build` to verify `dist` folder creation
3. Deploy to Netlify using the clean React setup

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Test local build
npm install
npm run build
ls -la dist/  # Should show built files

# If dist folder is created successfully, deploy to Netlify
```

## Status: Fixed - Ready for deployment
The React app should now build successfully and create the `dist` directory required by Netlify.
