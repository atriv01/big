# ðŸ”¥ REMOVING ANGULAR CONFLICTS - FINAL FIX

## Issue: Build Failing Due to Angular Directory Structure

The `/src` directory contains Angular project files that are interfering with the React/Vite build process, preventing the creation of the `dist` directory.

## Angular Files Found (Causing Conflicts):
- `/src/app/` - Complete Angular application structure  
- `/src/index.html` - Angular HTML template
- `/src/main.ts` - Angular bootstrap file
- `/src/polyfills.ts` - Angular polyfills
- `/src/styles.scss` - Angular SCSS styles

## Solution: Complete Removal
These files must be completely removed to allow the React/Vite build to succeed.

## React Files (Correct Structure):
- `/index.html` - React entry point âœ…
- `/main.tsx` - React bootstrap âœ…  
- `/App.tsx` - Main React component âœ…
- `/components/` - React components âœ…

---
*After removal, the build will successfully create the `dist` directory.*
