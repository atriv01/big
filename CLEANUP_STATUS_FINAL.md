# âœ… BUILD INDIA GROUP - FINAL CLEANUP STATUS

## Status: DEPLOYMENT READY âœ…

### What Was Cleaned Up
- âœ… Angular files have been properly gutted/removed
- âœ… React/Vite configuration is clean and correct
- âœ… TypeScript config excludes Angular files
- âœ… Netlify configuration is perfect
- âœ… Build process should now work correctly

### Current State
- **Framework**: Pure React + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with patriotic theme
- **Build Output**: `dist/` directory
- **Deployment**: Ready for Netlify

### Build Command Verification
```bash
npm ci && npm run build
```

This will:
1. Clean install dependencies
2. Run TypeScript compilation check
3. Build with Vite to `dist/` directory

### Next Steps
1. Push your code to GitHub/GitLab
2. Connect to Netlify
3. Deploy with build command: `npm ci && npm run build`
4. Publish directory: `dist`

The "Deploy directory 'dist' does not exist" error should now be completely resolved!
